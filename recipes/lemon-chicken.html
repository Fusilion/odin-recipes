        <p><strong>NOTE: </strong>It’s ideal to season your chicken with salt and pepper a day or two in advance for maximum flavor. Place the seasoned chicken in the fridge, uncovered to help crisp the skin and create more flavor. If you’re not a planner that’s ok. This will still be delicious without the extra dry time in the fridge. </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 pounds small, waxy potatoes, such as red, fingerlings, or yellow finn</li>
        <li>1 pint (2 cups) cherry tomatoes</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons capers</li>
        <li>1 large lemon</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>2 large cloves garlic, grated on a microplane or finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, divided</li>
        <li>2 1/2 pounds bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs</li>
        <li>Freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>1/3 cup fresh basil, roughly chopped, for garnish</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 425°F.</li>
        <li>Slice the potatoes into 1/8 to 1/4-inch-thick rounds.</li>
        <li>Pile the potatoes, cherry tomatoes, and capers on a large baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Cut the lemon in half and squeeze 1 tablespoon juice into a small bowl. Cut the remaining lemon half into several wedges and reserve for later. In the small bowl with the lemon, whisk in the olive oil, cumin, garlic, and 1 teaspoon salt. Pour over the potatoes, tomatoes, and capers and use your hands to coat everything. Spread out the potatoes, tomatoes, and capers into a single layer.</li>
        <li>Season the chicken thighs on both sides with 1 1/2 teaspoons salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste.</li>
        <li>Nestle the chicken thighs amongst the potatoes, tomatoes, and capers spacing them evenly across the baking sheet. It’s ok if some of the potatoes are beneath the chicken.</li>
        <li>Roast for about 40 minutes, spooning or brushing the chicken with pan juices and stirring the potatoes about halfway through. The sheet pan dinner is done when the potatoes are tender and starting to brown and the chicken is tender, the skin is crispy, and the meat registers 165°F with an instant-read thermometer.</li>
        <li>Add the reserved lemon wedges to the baking sheet. Scatter the basil over everything. Let the chicken rest for 10 minutes and serve.</li>
    </ol>
